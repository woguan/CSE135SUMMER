                <h2>Course Statement</h2>

                <p class="alt" data-col-flow data-col-flow-2>Web programming is by far one of the most difficult forms of programming facing today's computer scientists and while there are many site builders, few are truly skilled in the field. One of the primary reasons for this is the sheer number of programming technologies in a modern Web site. To attack the construction of Web site technologies it is often necessary to divide the study between those which are primarily client-side and those that are server-side In this class we present a complete overview of server-side Web technologies in light of the role in a complete Web system. We start first with a quick review of the environment of Web development with a full overview of pieces that may have missed by students not versed in client-side development.  Next we make sure to in more detail discuss the architecture of the server-side discussing HTTP, Web servers, server-side programming technology in general and infrastructure issues. Once the environment is well understood we turn our attention to the programming technologies starting with older technologies, working our way through scripting environments such as PHP and server-side programming environments such as Java servlets. The main aim of the survey approach is to emphasize the same ness and reliance on HTTP as opposed to the differences of framework or language issues.  Special topics including Web application security, Web services, delivery optimization, server-side JavaScript, and general site management.  These topics as well as the cultural effects on Web app developers are woven throughout the course.  Node.js and the use of server-side JavaScript for a full end-to-end JavaScript application solution will be explored in this edition of the course.</p>
